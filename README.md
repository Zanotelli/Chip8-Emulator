# Chip8-Emulator

---
## Why make it

Small project made with the intention to deepen my understanding of the
`Python` language, as well as giving my first try to emulation and
virtual machines creation.

Tris project was selected in te list available at [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-emulator--virtual-machine).
The tutorial used as base to develop this project was 
[Emulation Basics: Write your own Chip 8 Emulator/Interpreter](http://omokute.blogspot.com/2012/06/emulation-basics-write-your-own-chip-8.html),
and the documentation used about the `Chip8` language was the one available
[here](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#font).

## How to run it

Inside the project, we have a `games` directory, where a couple of
games are available. To run the emulator, you first need to open the
`cmd` on the folder with the `main.py` file. Then, you just need to
run the following command:

    python3 main.py

You will notice that a new window will be opened, with a list of
all games in the `games` folder. Select the game you want to play
and have fun !!
